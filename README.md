# Disp41r-Super-Voting-System
a super super super voting system on near block chain :)
Finish! I call it super voting system, because it is really cool!
contract address : dispa1r_vote.testnet
- Functions:
    + at the init function, you can set the title of voting and the deadline, you just need to input how long it will last, and contract will calculate the end time automaticly
    + each wallet account can only vote for one candidate once
    + you can vote with near, or without near, if you vote with near, your vote will be more weighted with some algorithm, you can also check the candidate you voted for!!!
    + in addition to overtime voting will end, you can also actively end it
    + you can view the current winners in real time !!!
    + if the vote ends, contract will divide all the near in the pool evenly among users who voted for the winner!!!(i think it is really cool)
